## 1. Purpose and Background

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Students and educators who use digital documents — PowerPoint slides, PDF handouts, Word notes, or plain text — as their primary study materials have no fast, automated way to convert that content into assessment material. Creating MCQs manually is time-consuming, often misses key concepts, and produces questions of inconsistent quality and difficulty.

### 1.2 Solution

AI Quiz Generator is a single-page web application that accepts any supported document and uses a large language model to automatically extract key concepts and generate high-quality MCQs. Users can configure difficulty and question count, take an interactive quiz, and receive AI-powered feedback explaining their mistakes.

### 1.3 Goals

| Goal | Success Metric |
|---|---|
| Support multiple document formats | Accept .pptx, .pdf, .docx, and .txt without errors |
| Automate MCQ generation from document content | Questions generated in < 30 seconds for a typical document |
| Support multiple difficulty levels | 3 distinct tiers with measurably different question types |
| Deliver interactive quiz experience | One-question-per-screen, timer, progress bar |
| Provide learning feedback | AI explanation generated for every wrong answer |
| Professional, intuitive UI | No user documentation required to operate the app |

## 6. User Flows

### 6.1 Happy Path

```
Start → Upload document (.pptx/.pdf/.docx/.txt)
→ [AI extracts content] → Set questions + difficulty
→ [AI generates MCQs] → Answer Q1…Qn → Submit
→ View score + explanations
```

### 6.2 Upload Error Flow

```
Upload file → File > 25 MB OR unsupported type OR no extractable text
→ Error message shown → User uploads a different file
```

### 6.3 Generation Error Flow

```
Generate Questions → API error or malformed JSON
→ Error message shown → User clicks Retry
```

---

## 7. Constraints

- The application requires an active internet connection to call the OpenRouter API.
- Image-based PDFs (scanned documents without embedded text) will yield no extractable content — OCR is not supported.
- Password-protected PDF and DOCX files are not supported.
- Session history is lost when the browser tab is closed or the server restarts.
- The AI model may occasionally return malformed JSON; the app handles this with a retry prompt.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

1. A `.pptx`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` file each produce the requested number of well-formed MCQs.
2. Selecting a difficulty level produces noticeably different question types.
3. Selecting an answer highlights it and does not show the answer twice.
4. The results screen shows the correct answer for every wrong response.
5. AI explanations are displayed for every incorrectly answered question.
6. The History page shows an entry after completing a quiz, including the file format.
7. The Analytics page updates averages correctly after multiple quizzes across different formats.
8. The Settings page displays `.pptx .pdf .docx .txt` as supported file types.
